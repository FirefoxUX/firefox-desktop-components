The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.\n\ncert-error-mitm-connection = { -brand-short-name } uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.\n\ncert-error-trust-unknown-issuer-intro = Someone could be trying to impersonate the site and you should not continue.\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.\ncert-error-trust-unknown-issuer = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust { $hostname } because its certificate issuer is unknown, the certificate is self-signed, or the server is not sending the correct intermediate certificates.\n\ncert-error-trust-cert-invalid = The certificate is not trusted because it was issued by an invalid CA certificate.\n\ncert-error-trust-untrusted-issuer = The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.\n\ncert-error-trust-signature-algorithm-disabled = The certificate is not trusted because it was signed using a signature algorithm that was disabled because that algorithm is not secure.\n\ncert-error-trust-expired-issuer = The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate has expired.\n\ncert-error-trust-self-signed = The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.\n\ncert-error-trust-symantec = Certificates issued by GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Symantec, Thawte, and VeriSign are no longer considered safe because these certificate authorities failed to follow security practices in the past.\n\ncert-error-untrusted-default = The certificate does not come from a trusted source.\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.\ncert-error-domain-mismatch = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }.\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.\n#   $alt-name (string) - Alternate domain name for which the cert is valid.\ncert-error-domain-mismatch-single = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for <a data-l10n-name=\"domain-mismatch-link\">{ $alt-name }</a>.\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.\n#   $alt-name (string) - Alternate domain name for which the cert is valid.\ncert-error-domain-mismatch-single-nolink = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }.

The certificate is only valid for the following names: { $subject-alt-names }\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.\n#   $not-after-local-time (Date) - Certificate is not valid after this time.\ncert-error-expired-now = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are valid for a set time period. The certificate for { $hostname } expired on { $not-after-local-time }.\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.\n#   $not-before-local-time (Date) - Certificate is not valid before this time.\ncert-error-not-yet-valid-now = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are valid for a set time period. The certificate for { $hostname } will not be valid until { $not-before-local-time }.\n\n# Variables:\n#   $error (string) - NSS error code string that specifies type of cert error. e.g. unknown issuer, invalid cert, etc.\ncert-error-code-prefix = Error code: { $error }\n\n# Variables:\n#   $error (string) - NSS error code string that specifies type of cert error. e.g. unknown issuer, invalid cert, etc.\ncert-error-code-prefix-link = Error code: <a data-l10n-name=\"error-code-link\">{ $error }</a>\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with SSL error.\n#   $errorMessage (string) - Error message corresponding to the type of error we are experiencing.\ncert-error-ssl-connection-error = An error occurred during a connection to { $hostname }. { $errorMessage }\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.\ncert-error-symantec-distrust-description = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities. Most browsers no longer trust certificates issued by GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Symantec, Thawte, and VeriSign. { $hostname } uses a certificate from one of these authorities and so the website’s identity cannot be proven.\n\ncert-error-symantec-distrust-admin = You may notify the website’s administrator about this problem.\n\ncert-error-old-tls-version = This website might not support the TLS 1.2 protocol, which is the minimum version supported by { -brand-short-name }.\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hasHSTS (Boolean) - Indicates whether HSTS header is present.\ncert-error-details-hsts-label = HTTP Strict Transport Security: { $hasHSTS }\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hasHPKP (Boolean) - Indicates whether HPKP header is present.\ncert-error-details-key-pinning-label = HTTP Public Key Pinning: { $hasHPKP }\n\ncert-error-details-cert-chain-label = Certificate chain:\n\nopen-in-new-window-for-csp-or-xfo-error = Open Site in New Window\n\n# Variables:\n#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website blocked by csp or xfo error.\ncsp-xfo-blocked-long-desc = To protect your security, { $hostname } will not allow { -brand-short-name } to display the page if another site has embedded it.
